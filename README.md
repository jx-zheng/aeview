HackRx 2023 Project - Team AeScript

This project was created for, and submitted to, HackRx 2023. This submission won 1st place. 

"AeView is a mobile app that allows for Healthcare Professionals to virtually landmark a patientâ€™s body for education on drug administration, using the power of Augmented Reality (AR) technology. Virtual markers can be placed on the body to indicate where injections should be administered, and previous injections are tracked to facilitate proper site rotation, preventing injury caused by lipohypertrophy."

This repository contains the iOS mobile app built with SwiftUI, ARKit, and RealityKit.
